### 🙌 Hi !!!! 🙌

You can call me Brian (✿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), YoonHyuk ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 👉, or even Brinco [̲̅$̲̅( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)̲̅$̲̅] ! I am a Junior studying computer science at University of Michigan with interests in web development 🕸️, hardware-software integration 🤓, and planes ✈️.



I'm always excited to talk about building cool apps, playing the guitar, or cooking Asian food!
